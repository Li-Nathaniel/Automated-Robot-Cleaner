# Automated-Robot-Cleaner
This code was made in collaboration with Chris Burca, Geffrey Chu, and Ryan McIntyre for my MTE 121 and MTE 100 course project. The source code is a C file written in RobotC, a specialized version of C designed to communicate with a LEGO EV3 brick. The code autonomously drive the robot to complete full cleaning cycles around a table according the user's selection.
